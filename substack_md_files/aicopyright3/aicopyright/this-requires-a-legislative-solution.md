### Updates

#### “This requires a legislative solution…” Maybe first, let’s take a breath…

Writer and media consultant [Rob Salkowitz](https://twitter.com/robsalk) put together [a must-read for ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robsalkowitz/2022/09/16/ai-is-coming-for-commercial-art-jobs-can-it-be-stopped)_[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robsalkowitz/2022/09/16/ai-is-coming-for-commercial-art-jobs-can-it-be-stopped)._

The article tackles the legal uncertainty question head on. It quotes art director James Juan: _“‘On the business side, we need some clarity around copyright before using AI-generated work instead of work by a human artist,’ said Juan. ‘The problem is, the current copyright law is outdated and is not keeping up with the technology.’”_

Copyright insiders will see it differently: the doctrine of fair use gives a pretty well-tested way of applying copyright law to new technologies. It’s just that these new AI tools may not pass the fair use test.

Somewhat alarmingly, the article also quotes a White House AI official sounding shocked and surprised by the way that LLMs are trained, which has been pretty well-known for many years, and raised as a copyright law issue at the Berkman Klein Center [back in 2017](https://cyber.harvard.edu/story/2017-09/artificial-intelligences-fair-use-crisis) at least. Data scientist Daniela Braga sits on the White House Task Force for AI Policy, and she is cited as saying: _“They’re training the AI on his work without his consent? I need to bring that up to the White House office…If these models have been trained on the styles of living artists without licensing that work, there are copyright implications. There are rules for that. This requires a legislative solution.”_

#### [Getty bans AI-generated images over copyright concerns](https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/21/23364696/getty-images-ai-ban-generated-artwork-illustration-copyright)

From _The Verge:_

The article quotes a statement from Getty Images CEO Greg Peters _“‘There are real concerns with respect to the copyright of outputs from these models and unaddressed rights issues with respect to the imagery, the image metadata and those individuals contained within the imagery,’ said Peters. Given these concerns, he said, selling AI artwork or illustrations could potentially put Getty Images users at legal risk. ‘We are being proactive to the benefit of our customers,’ he added.”_

They are not the only image platform to do so, but clearly when a commercial heavyweight like Getty weighs in like this it should be a matter of concern to the LLM operators.

This was published more than a week ago, but since this the first edition of the newsletter, I will point to it. Kevin Roose of _The_ _New York Times_ — he of [the first AI-authored book review in the Grey Lady](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/21/books/review/the-age-of-ai-henry-kissinger-eric-schmidt-daniel-huttenlocher.html) — used WALL-E2 as the lead-in to a discussion of the massive leap in AI capabilities over the last year or so. He made the key point that we need to move AI up on the agenda for public discussion, and find more informed ways to talk about it, and quickly.

 **Indeed, that’s why I’ve started this send out these emails!**
